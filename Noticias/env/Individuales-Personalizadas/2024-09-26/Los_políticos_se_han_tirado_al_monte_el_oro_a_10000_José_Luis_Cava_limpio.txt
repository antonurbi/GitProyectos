Hello, how are you? Very good and as
you can see, cloudy mornings from Madrid,
the cool weather is appreciated. The first
question we are going to ask today is the
following. Why did the profitability
of the 10-year American bond react
with increases to the rate cut?  Pell interest rate,
as you can see in
this graph, reached the area of ​​3.6 and
just after announcing the interest rate cut
we found that the
bond income increased but there is more
despite this increase in  the
profitability of the 10-year American Bond
we find that the
upward trend of Gold has been accentuated
as you can see in this graph
And then The question is good and
why the first thing that comes to mind is that
the participants in the market  They may
be discounting an error by Powell.
Market participants may be
discounting that inflation is going to increase
and that Powell has made a mistake.
Well, we expected that by
cutting interest rates by 25
basis points, but we already know that he has cut
more, he has cut 50.  basis points
although it was not necessary to help
China so that China could implement its
new monetary stimulus package well
well but inflation has skyrocketed
inflationary expectations Well
then if we go to the Federal Reserve Bank
of Atlanta as you can see
average inflation for the
next 5 years is around 2%
Yes yes it has increased from 1.8 to 2%
but it is anchored around 2%
therefore the ultimate reason I do not think is
inflation nor do I think it is  has made
a monetary policy error, well, what
could be the reason? Well, I believe
that the reason is the same as always, the
politicians have thrown themselves into the bush, just
look at burning Harris and just
look at Tran. Yes, they have differences, but in
what way?  What do the two have in common in
that neither wants to reduce the
public deficit in that neither wants to reduce the
level of public debt
therefore the most likely thing is that the
public debt will continue to grow the
public deficit will continue to grow And for that reason
the profitability of  The good ones, even though
pog has cut the interest rate, it does not
go down and that is the reason why the price
of gold is in a strong
upward trend, but look at what
is happening in Europe, the situation in
Europe is the following: we are,
we are  finding that in France
the Public deficit with respect to the pif
for the year 2024 will be around
5.1, one of the worst in history,
the situation in France is such that the
differential between the Spanish public debt
and the public debt  France
has narrowed and practically zero,
as the Financial Times says today,
France should cut the
public deficit to send it to 3%, but
this scenario is not realistic, just as the central banker himself says,
as you can see
here.  of
France even tells us that to
reduce the public deficit from 5.1 to 3,
they would need 5 years and also adopt the
measures that were necessary and with the
political situation in France
what is clear is that they are not going to reduce
the public  In the next 5 years, it
will most likely increase if they do not
manage to reduce the public deficit and
therefore the public debt continues to
increase and they do not reduce it. Where
will the price of Gold be in 5
years at 10,000, I will leave it to you.  here to
you to meditate on it
goodbye until later have a good
[Applause]
