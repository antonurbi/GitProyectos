Hello, how are you? Very good and as
you can see, wonderful mornings from
Madrid, this stupid war between the
governments of Israel and Iran forces us to
consider what
the possible objectives that the
Israeli armed forces can bomb and
the economic consequences that could be.  This
may have That is, what happens from an
economic point of view If the
Israeli armed forces decided to bomb
the largest oil export terminal,
they would say what would happen If instead
of bombing those facilities they would choose
to bomb the refineries What
economic consequences would it have to
answer this question?  question, the first thing
we have to take into account is that Iran
produces 3.6 million barrels
of oil per day, according to what it exports
approximately 1.7 between oil and
condensed products, that is,
ultralight oil. Who is the main
buyer, well, the only buyer of
this  production is Chinese Why Because
it is the only country that dares to
defy the
sanctions imposed by the United
States well agree what would happen
then If the armed forces
bomb the island of C where
the largest terminal of
export of oil from Iran Well,
it is very easy that in that specific case
that oil would not go to the market, China
would not be able to buy it, Iran's response
would be to close the Dor Mud strait and the
price of oil would increase and
Israel would have to pay for more
expensive oil and  All of us, this also does not
seem to be a profitable nation from an economic point of
view, okay,
we are talking about the economy, we are not
talking about other things. Well, what
would happen if they decided to bomb
the refineries? Well, in that
specific case, we would find that Iran would
not.  to be able to process 2.9 million
barrels a day, export them accordingly
and who would buy them from China and what
would China do? Well, buy it at a
cheap price. And then what would the price of oil
do and and Iran could not react
by closing the Strait of Hormuz,
thereby  the price of oil would fall,
look, but there is even more damage
in that specific case. What would happen in
that case? From an internal point of
view, the Iranian authorities
would have to buy refined products.
I'm thinking gasoline. I'm thinking
diesel or also fuel for the
heating for the residents of
Iran but since everyone
wants to buy those refined products,
the price of refined products
would rise for them and globally and would
harm us. And
everything related to
refined products would probably rise due to the greater
demand that would arise.  agreement but of
course, since Iran
would buy the bacos more expensively, this gasoline, this
diesel and this fuel for
heating when it comes to selling it to
the Iranians, it would have to
subsidize because otherwise
a social revolt would be provoked, therefore from
a point of view  Seen from a
strictly economic point of view,
Israel will probably try to
bomb the refineries and logically
Iran will try to defend them. These are
the consequences that my opinion could
derive from one option or the other.
This is truly unfortunate.
Never in my life would I have thought that
I would have  I have to comment on this but the
times are like this, a real disgrace,
we have politicians who seem like
psychopaths, goodbye, see you later, have a
very good day
