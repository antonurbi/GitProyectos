we are going to Colombia we are going with this
cumbia Hello how are you Very good morning
from Madrid as you can
see we enjoyed a
beautiful morning It is raining a little the
sky is cloudy and I am going to take a
walk around this park  So precious, the
question I am going to ask you
today is the following: Why is
bitcoin rising so decisively
this morning? Bitcoin has already set
a maximum at 71,500, and as
you can see in this graph, it is
coming out of that lateral movement.  of
that enormous lateral movement that
began in the month of April of the year 2024
but we also have gold
against the Dollar. You see that the
trend of Gold against the Dollar has
been very bullish, it has been strong and we
find that it does not correct and now
We are seeing how the price of
Gold against the Dollar is above
2750 well we know what is happening
behind we will know the purchases of the br
we will know the fiscal imbalance we know
the geopolitical tensions that you are already
seeing that the
geopolitical tensions are going less in the  We have
realized that here Israel Iran is
bringing a little theater Incredible how it reveals
the sharp fall experienced by the
price of oil They have us crazy
but now what is behind the
rise of bitcoin what is behind the
rise of Gold in addition to what  We know,
man, my opinion, what's behind it
is the following. I think it's
Endo Trump's fiscal policy.
Honestly, I tell you that I'm
terrified. I don't know how people can
vote in favor of a fiscal policy that
is an experiment and we don't know.
How far can it take us,
especially when we are all watching and we
all know that we are in a
moment in which the system is
exhausted and in which we are approaching a
new international order if you
now carry out a fiscal experiment of
this kind?  magnitude because the uncertainty is
skyrocketing, let's see
what tran has proposed in recent
days, tran in recent days has said
that he is going to provoke those
Tax incentives that he approved in 2017
when he was president, well that reduces
tax collection and will  to extend from
the year 2025 well
secondly he also wants to increase the
deductions from the
Federal income tax rate for families
that obviously reduces
tax collection but he has said more, look at
what he has said he says he is going to declare
Exempt from Federal
personal income tax to
firefighters, police officers and listen to military personnel and
veterans. How many people are these 20
million people? Are 20 million people on average going to be declared
exempt from paying personal income tax?
Let's imagine that this
people earn 8000, we could not find
that the decrease in tax collection is
impressive,
therefore tran has to cause an
epic increase in some other tax. I already know it, we
all know it is going to be. It is going to increase
tariffs, but assuming it
increases the  Tariffs to compensate for
the loss of tax revenue. At what
level would you have to increase
tariffs when the United States imports
3 trillion dollars? How much would you have to
raise them by 60 percent?  That's impossible. In the
middle of raising it by 20, 30%, okay,
okay. Well, that's how it would have a fiscal deficit,
okay, in addition to triggering
inflation, with which we would find
that the fiscal deficit would increase.
Well, now it comes and more and it says more. Well,
I'm coming.  Here I am the one who is going to
reduce all public spending. I believe it. I don't
trust it. I don't like it. I
trust it well but it's just vaar and he says that
of the 82 of the public spending, don't even touch it.
So he has
18 left imagem emos that ilol ma  achieves its
objective and that of the 18 that it has left of
public spending to cut, it reduces it by
33, which would already be the lemon repera,
even so the fiscal deficit would
continue to continue reasoning well, we reached a
primary fiscal deficit of
6%, an outrage, add to it You the
payments  of interest that the figures they
give us are lies, surely the
payment of interest on the public debt is
much higher, I agree, especially
taking into account that Jan is
financing it with the most expensive interest rate,
which is the treasury notes.  We
continue to reason well We have a
huge primary fiscal deficit of 6% and
also payment of interest and now the
question is how to finance two
options: either we issue public debt or
Tito Pogel comes to issue public debt to
buy the public debt of the
trum government  print bills man I think
that Tito Poel is not going to
issue more money out of the air So if you
don't buy interest rates would skyrocket
then we find ourselves in a
scenario of uncertainty in which there is
a key factor that everyone accepts
that  Inflation is going to increase and
here we already understand why bitcoin goes up
and why gold goes up and then
how far can bitcoin go up,
man, I get the feeling of
how this is going as a trans person, he continues speaking
on November 6th.  day I win the
elections well I don't mean
that I'm going to win it because I want it
I simply see what the
polls say maybe the bcoin
we already have it at
73,000 and the following week at
80,000 well the truth is I
I'm leaving this to you here. The truth is, I'm
very worried. I can really
tell you that this morning, when I
woke up, the first thing I thought about was this:
where are these people going to take us? I'm
leaving it here for
you.  Think about it, goodbye, see you later,
have a great time
[Applause]
