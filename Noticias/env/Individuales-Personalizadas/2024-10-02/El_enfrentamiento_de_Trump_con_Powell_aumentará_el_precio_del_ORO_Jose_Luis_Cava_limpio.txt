Hello, how are you? Good morning from
Madrid, the question I'm going to ask
you is the following, if we assume that
Tran wins the elections in the United
States, it's going to be a mess in the
economic field, you know
perfectly well that Tran doesn't.  He is going to reduce
the Public deficit, according to what is most
likely that it will increase and he has
a star measure which is to
increase tariffs on
imports from 10 to 20%. He wants to put
a tariff and on imports from
China he says that he is going to put the  60 per
tariff, what does this mean from an
economic point of view? Well,
it's going to make a mess and it's going to confront
the Fed with a pell dilemma before
kicking it out, surely it's going to
face the next problem, we
find that  If you raise
tariffs, the first question to
ask yourself is, will the
trade deficit of the United States decrease? Well, I don't
agree in such a way that even if one
raises tariffs on imports, it
doesn't reduce the trade deficit. I
agree because the others will.  They are going to
respond by increasing tariffs and
in the end the trade deficit
remains where it was agreed. Second
question, what is going to happen internally?
Well, internally, it is most
likely that the price level will increase.  It is
likely that the price level will increase,
that economic activity will slow down
and that unemployment will increase. Yes,
yes, yes, this is true, at least in
theory, okay, and then the
Fed. How is the Fed going to react here?
have a dilemma How do I react, do I raise
interest rates to stop
inflation or lower them because
the level of unemployment is going to increase? Let's
assume the first scenario: If
inflation increases, the Fed will have
to think and say, well, this is a problem.
a one-time increase and it is
transitory Well, why am I going to
modify my monetary policy if I don't
have it, I'm not responsible or it's not because of the
increase in the money supply
that prices are rising
okay. So they could say well no.
I raise the estp for interest but here is
that the problem is not only the
increase in the price level that
we are seeing as a
consequence of the increase in
tariffs but that we will have to see the
inflationary expectations therefore
the Fed will raise interest rates if
As a result of the tran measure,
inflationary expectations increase well. I think that the most
likely thing is that the
next question could lower the rates
due to interest in the increase in unemployment,
well, if
inflationary expectations do not increase, it could
react by lowering the rate.  of interest
but I sincerely believe not
Therefore, the most likely reaction
of the Federal Reserve system At the
time of tran tariffs will be to
increase interest rates And
then what is tran going to do to death
with The Fed to  death with The Fed, the
first thing it is going to do is when
P's term ends in
2025, of course, logically, terminate him and appoint
a president of the Federal Reserve
who is afa to him. Third question, this
means the end of the Federal Reserve,
it could mean it.  but not because of Trump but
because he sets a precedent if from
this moment on we find that the
presidents who come put
people in charge of the Fed who are related to the
party and dedicated to the president, it
is very likely that the Fed will lose
credibility as an
independent institution.  In Spain we are
suffering from this, we have seen how the
current government has put in charge of the
Central Bank a person who was a former
minister and supports the party. This fact
discredits the institution and, above all,
damages its independence. Basic pillar.
Finally, we are left to
analyze whether or not  camala Harris and
trad are not going to reduce the public deficit and
continue indebtedness. What is the
most important graph that we have to
take into account and what is more
important is
an ounce of gold at
2400 is cheap or is it expensive, I am going to
leave it to you  to you to think about it but I
want to finish with this graph
you see how the public debt evolves
and you see the high correlation
it has with the price of gold if
neither Camala nor Trump are going to reduce the
public deficit then the most normal thing is  May
the price of Gold continue its
cist trend and therefore you
can now decide what you think is most
convenient, goodbye until later have a
good day Oh
