Financial Metrics Calculation Models:

Group 1: Profitability and Operating Margin
Metrics:
- Operating Margin
- Net Profit Margin
- EBITDA Margin
- Gross Profit Margin
- Basic EPS
- Diluted EPS

Calculations:
1. Margin as a Percentage of Revenue:
   Operating Margin % = (Operating Income / Total Revenues) * 100
   Apply similar formulas for other margins.

2. EPS Growth (year-over-year):
   EPS Growth = (Current Period EPS - Previous Period EPS) / Previous Period EPS * 100

Group 2: Growth and Financial Performance
Metrics:
- Total Revenue Growth Rate
- Free Cash Flow
- Various Operating and Financial Trends

Calculations:
1. Total Revenue Growth Rate:
   Revenue Growth Rate = (Current Period Revenues - Previous Period Revenues) / Previous Period Revenues * 100

2. Trends (such as moving averages or linear regressions for):
   - EBITDA Trend
   - Net Income Trend
   - EPS Trends (Basic and Diluted)

Group 3: Financial Stability and Operational Efficiency
Metrics:
- Cash Flow Stability
- Interest Coverage Ratio
- R&D to Revenue Ratio
- SG&A to Revenue Ratio
- Expense to Revenue Ratio

Calculations:
1. Cash Flow Stability:
   Coefficient of Variation of Cash Flow = (Standard Deviation of Cash Flow) / (Mean of Cash Flow)

2. Operational and Efficiency Ratios:
   R&D to Revenue Ratio = (R&D Expenses / Total Revenues) * 100

Group 4: Other Financial Factors
Metrics:
- Effective Tax Rate (ETR)
- Unusual Expenses/Incomes
- Impact on Net Income

Calculations:
1. Effective Tax Rate:
   ETR = (Income Tax / Income Before Taxes) * 100

2. Adjusted Impact of Non-Recurring Items on Net Income:
   Adjusted Impact = Net Income Â± Non-Recurring Items

Group 5: General Categories
These categories can be evaluated using comparative analysis or percentiles as mentioned earlier, based on available sector data.

Group 6: Other Indicators
Metric:
- Normalized Earnings

Calculations:
1. Normalized Earnings:
   Normalized Earnings = Net Income - Non-Recurring Items
