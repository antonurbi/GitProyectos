Hello, how are you? Very good morning from
Madrid, as you can see,
we have a cloudy morning with rain and
wind. The question we are going to ask ourselves
today is the following: Does globalization
cause inequality or reduce the
growth of inequality? To
answer this  question, the first thing
we have to take into account are the
facts, despite the
geopolitical tensions between China and the
United States, we are seeing that the
world is not
deglobalization China is
increasing in the Red Zone of the
graph this super Asian commercial Avis  It
corresponds to the
trade deficit of the West, as
you can see in this graph, you will see
at the bottom the blue area how
this trade deficit continues to
increase. Then the conclusion is
simple, regardless of what you think is
good or bad in relation to
globalization.  it is a fact that
the world is taking place no It is
comical deglobalization How
trade works he told us that trade was a
technological revolution Yes yes yes a
technological revolution says yes think
of a machine okay we think of
a machine he says on the one hand put
oranges and on the other hand luxury cars come out
Ah okay it's true you
put oranges and on the other hand you get
utility cars Ah It's true you put
oranges and you get pens Ah It's
true he says the problem we have with
the machine he said is that it is not in
Our country in this case is not in
Spain. If it were in Spain,
everyone would say that the machine is fantastic
and that it clearly illustrates the benefits
of specialization. What
Adam Smith taught us says the problem with
the machine is that it is outside of Spain.  He
says Ah okay, I say And what happens with that? Well,
he says that politicians get into the machine
and What do
politicians do? He says two things: a
tariff policy putting tariffs on
imports and, on the other hand, an
economic policy that can favor or
harm exports.  Oh okay And
he gave us the following example
United States The United States from 1900 to 2000
has carried out a
trade policy with rich countries it has
exchanged with rich countries example
simplifying it says it is as if it had
put orange and had obtained
luxury cars this  reduces
inequality but obviously not the
economy if not you do not adopt measures that
reduce inequality it generates it.
So if the government carries out
policies aimed at social policies
to reduce inequality then it is
increasing and this trade
with advanced economies with countries  rich
in which in exchange for oranges
we have luxury cars because they do not help
anything to reduce inequality now
what we do find is that in the
year 2020 China in the year 2000 China
joined the World
Trade Organization in agreement  And what does this mean?
Well, China began to
exchange goods and services with a
large number of countries in agreement, but
what goods did it exchange, well, man
of all kinds, but I would like
you to pay attention to those goods that
are part of the basket.  of
consumers I'm thinking about pens
I'm thinking about clothes I'm thinking about
the products we see in
Chinese stores by reducing the sales price
of these products it has also reduced
inequality I
agree if what we have seen at the level
of only goods and services  We take
into account globalization and the
exchanges that have occurred and the
mobilization that has occurred of
capital around the world or of
people who have exchanged ideas and
have gone to universities. We
obviously find that globalization should
produce benefits and what have they said?  The
facts, well, the facts clearly
show that yes. Over the last
25 years we have found that
emerging countries, those countries that
were not so advanced, have seen their
economic growth rates on
average have been above the average.
growth rate of advanced countries And
if we then look at
extreme poverty we find that there are many
that approximately 1,000 million
people have escaped
extreme poverty even though the population
will have increased by 2,000 million,
therefore we must consider  that
globalization has been behind this
improvement, according to it has been behind
this reduction in inequalities in
such a way that the increase in
inequality that could have
occurred between 1900 and 2000 in these
last 25 years has practically been
cancelled.
agreement However, despite this
fact, there are people and many people are emerging in the
West who are
against globalization. I
honestly do not understand it because I
am one of those who think that
globalization if you carry out an
appropriate policy, both tariffs and the
Promotion of exports
by governments really benefits
the population. Now let's
imagine, for example, that a country
specifically in the United States
right now decides to increase
tariffs on China by 60 percent. The
problem that we are going to take into account
is this.  It is going to improve people's situation. It
is going to reduce inequality or it is
going to increase it. First of all, it is going to
cause an increase in the
price level, which will increase
inequality. Think, for example, of
a pen that comes from China that  It is
used by a child who goes to school. If
you increase the tariff by 0%, the
price of the pen will increase
by 60% and this means that the income
available to the family will have to be
allocated a greater part to pens if
this is applied.  you to other
products and services we see that it is a
similar situation of agreement
therefore I put these
arguments here for you to meditate
on them In my opinion I believe that
globalization significantly benefits
the majority of citizens and
reduces  inequality finally you
ask me talk about bitcoin I'm not going to
talk about bitcoin I'm not going to talk about
bitcoin Why good because bitcoin
is in a lateral movement and it
bores me it's clear The idea is a
lateral movement within an
upward trend it is drawing  a
kind of triangle until it leaves
the triangle I think it will not
unfold an upward section now well if
you tell me it will come out above the
triangle it will come out below I am not a
guru I am not a fortune teller but I think it is
most likely  let it break above
Goodbye See you later, have a very good day
I have
