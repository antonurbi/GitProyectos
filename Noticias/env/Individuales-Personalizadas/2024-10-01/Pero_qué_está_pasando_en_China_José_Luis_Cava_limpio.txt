Hello, how are you? Good morning from
Madrid, as you can see, we have a
sunny morning. The question that we are not going to
ask today is the following: what is
happening in China and the most important:
how what
is happening in China can affect us.  is that the
economic authorities and the
financial authorities have approved a
fiscal and monetary stimulus package of
enormous magnitude, therefore it is most
likely that it will be successful. What has
happened is that chin pin, fed up with
social unrest, has told his
troops that cause a rebound in
internal demand and thus guarantee a
growth of 5%, which is what
the politburo has established. The stock markets, as
you can see in this graph, are
becoming rancid with a violent
upward movement. Where did the
money come from?  the money has come out of the
following: most of the
fund managers were short in the
Chinese indices and what has caused the
approval of this double package is that they have been
forced to
hastily cancel these
short positions and start buying  without
looking at the price level and then the
index goes up like crazy, for
better or worse, then we'll see what
happens. But to begin with, they have caused
a huge rebound. The next question we
have to ask ourselves is whether
this package or double
fiscal and monetary stimulus package is successful, this
means that inflation will rise
globally and this means that
the profitability of 10-year bonds will rise,
well, man, I sincerely believe
that not for a very simple reason because
the moment  The
Chinese economic authorities have chosen to
implement this enormous
economic stimulus. It is the very right time. It is
a very appropriate time. Why, well,
very easy because, firstly, we
find that
oil production exceeds demand. And
secondly, we find that
Saudi Arabia has made a huge
strategic error by unilaterally reducing
production under the quota that
OPEC had. We find that
Saudi Arabia now faces a
major problem on the one hand, its
growth rate, the growth rate of its
economy, which they  They expected it to
be above 4%, it is
around 04, which has been a
major fiasco, and the Saudi fiscal deficit
has increased. We also
find that it could end in
2024 at around 2.9 percent, but it will
reach  similar magnitudes in the
years in 2020 a similar magnitude
in the year 2025 but the most important thing is
that Saudi Arabia has the leadership when it
comes to setting the price of oil
accordingly. So what is Saudi Arabia going to do,
I think nothing more  that there is
one way left, which is to increase
production accordingly. Therefore, if at
a certain time when there is already
excess production, Saudi Arabia
increases its production and China's demand increases.
Well, we would find that the
price of oil would not have to
rise very strongly, it could
stabilize, rise a little but I do not
think it will start an upward trend as
the price does not start an
upward trend. I believe that
inflationary pressures at a global level will not
increase significantly due to the
increase in production in China of  I
agree and therefore the profitability
of the 10-year Bond should not
increase significantly.
I agree, I leave it here
for you to think about, goodbye, see you
later, have a very good day
he
