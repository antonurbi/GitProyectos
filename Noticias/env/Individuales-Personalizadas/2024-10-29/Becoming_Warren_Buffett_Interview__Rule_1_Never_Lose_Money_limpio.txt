well
a berkshire hathaway uh shareholders
meeting is
partly a um uh
a class in business it's partly a fun
festival it's sort of a
mardi gras for people that come every
year
it's a chance for us to have a lot of
fun and meet the people that have
entrusted us
with their money and we want to make
sure they have a good time and we hope
they learn
more about the not only berkshire but
just the attitude they should have
uh toward investments in general
we're a berkshire as a corporation
but it goes beyond that in in in
in terms of our our feeling toward the
people who are shareholders
we regard them as our partners uh
charlie and i are the managing partners
uh the others are are are silent
partners but
uh the attitude is partnership they're
they're not some
uh faceless group of people and that's
why at the annual meeting i you know i
love seeing forty thousand of them or so
it's it
it gives real meaning to what we're
doing every day
you know i i'm probably one of the few
ceos that actually enjoys
writing the annual report or as some
writers say i enjoy
having written them having written the
the the actual process of writing could
be
a lot of work but i want to uh
i want to tell them uh uh
or talk to them about what i would like
to know if our positions were reversed
and they were running the company and i
was the
shareholder so i i mentally envisioned
my
two sisters doris and bertie they're
very very smart
they have a very high percentage of
their net worth in berkshire so they're
interested
but they're not following business day
to day so i i
pretend that they've been gone for a
year and
i'm bringing them up to date about the
kind of things i would like to
to know if they were running the
business i was uh the silent partner
yeah ted williams wrote a book called
the science of hitting and ended he had
a uh
a picture of himself at bat and the
strike zone
broken into i think 77 uh
uh squares uh all the way from
the letters down to his knees and the
width of the plate and he said if he
the most important thing in in batting
was to
wait for the right pitch that if he
waited for the pitch that was really in
his sweet spot
he would bat 400 and if he had to swing
at something on the lower
corner he would probably bat 235 and
and in investing uh i'm in a no
called strike business which is the best
business you can be and
if if the count on ted went to 0 owen
two or one and two he
and that ball came across the plate in
the in that corner where he only batted
235 he still had to swing or he would
have been called out
in investing there are no call strikes i
can look at a thousand different
companies
and i don't have to be right on every
one of them or or
even 50 of them or even 25 of them i
just
the only the only way i can have a
strike call is if i swing and miss so i
can pick the ball i want to hit
and i can wait there and the pitcher can
throw pitch after pitch and if they are
not in my sweet spot
i don't have to swing and that's an
enormous advantage
over most businesses the problem of
course is that if you have an audience
that says yelling swing you bum while
you're waiting there with a bet on your
shoulder time after time you may get
tempted to
swing at the wrong pitches so you have
to make sure you're
that you don't psychologically get in
the position where you feel
you have to swing at pitches that really
aren't in your sweet spot
yeah probably probably if i make one
great decision every two years i'm
you have to make very very few right
decisions in investing in your life
you might say that a person who bought
berkshire hathaway 50 years ago only had
to make one decision and
and there's a temptation for people to
act far too frequently in stock simply
because they're so liquid
they know they can't buy and sell farms
every day or buy and sell apartment
houses every day
they can buy and sell stocks and that's
and in a very liquid market with very
low transaction costs and that should be
a huge advantage
but people turn it into a disadvantage
because they think the availability of
the opportunity to trade uh
is something that they have to uh take
advantage of every day and actually
active trading just costs them a lot of
commissions the main thing to do is buy
into a wonderful business and just sit
there with it
i don't i would say i get very very
little
hate mail uh uh
i i get a lot of requests for money and
i had one fellow that would ask me for
1.3 billion he broke me about 70 times
and he never dropped his price i kind of
admired his
position of non-negotiation but
i uh
there may be a social but probably when
i uh wrote about taxes i got i got a few
letters saying you know why don't you
uh send all your money to the u.s
government if you think it's so
wonderful
but i i would say there's very very very
little hate mail
well omaha and nebraska are home to me
and and and
uh uh i had a great time uh
growing up here until i was about 12 and
we moved to washington i
made lots of friends uh everything about
it seems like home i go back
uh i've probably gone back at least a
half a dozen times to my grammar school
rose hill and i go there for fairs they
may have occasionally i might even talk
to a
great school class or two i uh there's a
lot of
continuity there's a lot of community
there's a lot of friendship
uh i know the i probably know the
parents the grandparents now a lot of
people i meet
but if i go to a restaurant here there's
there's a lot of people just say hi
warren to me that that either i know or
that
that they're just friendly my children
had a good time growing up here
they had their aunts and uncles and
grandparents uh
living within a mile or two uh uh so
it's been
it's a very solid place and friendly
place uh in which to
uh grow up in in which to conduct a
business uh we have
25 people in the office and
if you go back a year ago to our
christmas party we're going to take a
picture of the 25 this year
it's the exact same 25 as a year ago the
exact same ones now we have a company
with 350
000 employees and here in the
headquarters i don't think there's
another company in the world that
probably didn't have
that we didn't go up one we didn't go
down one and we didn't change one
well working in omaha certainly
maximizes both
my enjoyment and my output in terms of
work i mean
everything is is made to order i live
five minutes away
from the office and i've been making
that five-minute trip back and forth now
for
what um 53 years uh
uh you know there's no stress i have i
have no stress whatsoever
in business that uh i think it's
probably helped me not only
live longer but and certainly live
happier as well
i had a when i came back from new york
in early 1956 uh i had no idea what i
was going to do i knew i was going to
take some classes at school i knew i was
going to do a lot of reading
i had no idea that i would set up an
investment partnership
but a few months after i came back some
members of the family uh
said what should we do with our money
and i said well i'm not going back in
the business of selling stocks but if
you would like to join me in a
partnership
uh somewhat along the lines of the one
i'd worked
for when i was with ben graham i said
i'll be glad to do it so
within a couple of months after coming
back i set up the first partnership
and i was then renting a house i never
owned a house to that point and
i was renting a house at uh a block and
a half away from the family grocery
store
and it had a little tiny room off the
bedroom and
that became the office and then two
years later i bought the house i live in
today in 1958
and that too had a room off the bedroom
and i worked out of that
room for about four years so there was
about six years in which i
uh worked at home i drove down and
picked up the mail
i wrote checks eventually i was running
11 partnerships finally i wrote all the
checks individually i filed 11 income
tax returns i took delivery on stocks
all the different companies i i was a
one-man band there for six years
there came a time at the start of 1962
i i moved to kiwi plaza they were just
building the building then
and finishing it and
i hired two people one one was a
secretary and one was a
a fellow that analyzed investments with
me bill scott
bill and i are still friends he still
lives in omaha and
and we started to look like we were
really were a business
by the time i moved to keyword plaza we
had seven million dollars in invested
we started the first partnership started
with a hundred and five thousand one
hundred dollars
i put up the hundred and the other
people put up the hundred and five
thousand
and then as as people came along uh and
saw what was being done in the earlier
partnerships i made this mistake of
forming new partnerships so
i had this multiple uh
multiple checks multiple tax returns and
all that sort of thing
finally it just made sense to put them
together so when i put it together in
january 1st 1962 we had 7 million
and a lot of that was new people that
had come in over the years and
and some but fair amount was profits
i closed down the partnerships well just
one partnership by that point
i closed down the partnership at the end
of 1969
because i really wasn't seeing uh
opportunities in the investment world
and
and and there were some crazy things
going on in the late 60s and
i didn't want to do i understood what
people were doing but i didn't believe
in what they were doing
so i didn't want to join that game on
the other hand i didn't like
sending it out and having having my
results look bad
so i decided to give the money back to
the partners i didn't think
i didn't want my competitive juices to
to force me to play in a game
where i really didn't think i had an
advantage anymore uh
so uh it was a it was a
lifestyle decision i had all the money i
needed and the partners had all done
and i had a way of providing for their
continued uh
shepherding by a couple of friends of
mine that were very good managers
the i had various social ideas too but
the two were not in conflict i could
have gone on on
on a double track throughout the rest of
my life and
and in a certain sense i have uh but not
in
i didn't have that all planned out back
in 1969 when i decided to wind up the
there was a time in in the late 60s when
my wife susie said to me she said i
don't mind being married
to the next to last guy in the country
to have a crew cut but she's i really
wouldn't want to be married to the last
guy so
at that point at that point i left the
crew cut style
we had a we had a terrific and susie was
great at planning parties and so
she was very imaginative we had loads of
friends uh
and uh uh so i like i liked the stage
delicatessen in new york so when we were
in new york i'd
we'd always go by there susie and i uh
so she decided to have a stage
delegation party in
in omaha and uh i don't know how many
people we had we had a lot of people
over that uh
that night and everybody had a lot of
fun it was it was the
it was the 1960s and and
she was imaginative about parties and
and and she was good at it she
she threw herself into it and came up
with a lot of great ideas and
i just went and ate the food and paid
the bills
the partnership had acquired control of
berkshire hathaway in 1965
and although i never took the chairman's
role or the president's role
i was in charge of berkshire hathaway we
owned control of it so
i made all the decisions i bought
national indemnity i bought this on
newspapers for it
the fellow who operated the textile
business checked with me on
buying new equipment and so i was the
ceo but i never saw
there was no reason to take the title
malcolm chase who was chairman was a
wonderful gentleman who had helped me in
acquiring control of berkshire so there
was no reason to
change his title he would remain the
chairman but he
he was not running the business he he
let me run the business and
there was no need it was clear that
buffett partnership was the controlling
shareholder
when we dissolved the partnership at the
end of 1969 and distributed the
the berkshire stock uh i took on the
title of chairman just
to formalize it going forward now that
the control block had really been
broken up with our various partners but
nothing really changed in 1970 from 1969
well i think i think the desire to
participate in
uh some of the conversation on
things like civil rights or or uh
the right to family planning or
something like that i mean it
if i can't speak out on who can i mean
you know i can't be
damaged in terms of my employer firing
me because i
made some talk someplace and and uh
uh so i've i've had strong feelings on
certain social policies uh you can't pop
off too
too often i mean there's uh some very
very rich guy who goes around the pining
on everything
can get a little get a little boring
after a while so i
i don't want to do it too often but when
i do see myself paying a lower tax rate
than anybody else in the office i mean
that bothers me then that
the degree of inequality in our in the
richest society that the world has ever
seen uh
bothers me i don't want to throw away
that greatest society that's ever
existed in the process of changing
things but i
uh i get i feel like speaking out i like
running berkshire but i
but i can't i can't pretend i'm not a
citizen either when
i've said at the shareholders meeting
that uh
i'm willing to work for a very small
salary but i'm not willing to
i'm not willing to put my morals in a
blind trust and uh
that does not come with a job so if if
people that are shareholders of
berkshire
are bothered a little bit about me
speaking on taxes or something of sort
you know they'll either have to accept
it or go elsewhere because i
i really don't feel i should give up my
citizenship just because i have a
a job as as head of a major corporation
america
america has been unbelievably good to me
and the and my family i you know there
were there's 7 billion people in this
world only 320 million plus
in the united states i mean i was very
very lucky to be
born in this country and have and and
and in the time when
america's prospered like never before so
it
uh and it isn't because i'm a better
person
than the guy next door i just i'm wired
in a certain way
that enables me just like some people to
go to chess some people are going to
bridge some
you know some people are good at writing
musical scores
i happen to be good at something that
pays off enormously
in this society would have paid off that
well 200 years ago it wouldn't have paid
off that well in many other countries
so america's been extraordinary for me
and it's going to be even better in the
future overall
so i just i would like to see everybody
participate not equally at all
but but nobody should have a
bad economic future in the united states
we can afford for
everybody to have a who's willing to
work to get a decent result in the
society
well the best the the best gift i was
ever given
uh was to have a father that i had when
i was born i made it
you know i had nothing to do with that
uh
i was also i i was genetically
blessed with a certain wiring that's
very useful in a
in a highly developed market system
where there's there's lots of chips on
the table and
you know i happen to be good at that
game and other people
are wonderful with their hands in
medicine they could do things surgically
that i never could do other people
couldn't
be out magnificently there's all kinds
of different gifts but i happen to be
given one
that that has enormous commercial value
at this time in this country uh
so i would uh but where i've really been
blessed
is is with the people that i've come in
contact with
some of them i i'll give myself a little
credit for for choosing to be associated
with but
if you start off with my dad i had no no
no uh
no voice in that and and just think of
this you know wonderful start that gave
me in the first
20 years of my life for really as long
as he lived
well charlie munger has been a wonderful
partner
he uh he's ungodly smart
he's he's he's got a much broader
intellect than i do he's
he's he's he's a smarter guy in about
100 fields than that i am
and he's he's
magnificent at being able to condense
important ideas into
just a very few words and uh he's always
honest in
in in what he tells me so i i listened
to him
in fact i just changed my behavior on
something last week
because of uh of uh probably a 10 word
sentence he
he said to me in investing
he had a big impact on me in in
moving me somewhat away from ben graham
and looking for
really wonderful companies at fair
prices rather than fair companies at
wonderful prices
so so he he moved me toward quality
businesses
and that was enormously important
because it enabled berkshire to scale up
in a way that would have been impossible
buying the kind of of lower grade
businesses we bought at cheap prices
originally
well susie uh when i was
in my teens uh uh i developed
really pretty decent skills in terms of
business or
but but i hadn't really come to terms
with the world exactly
and uh i was an unbalanced individual i
may still be but
but she uh susie
really put me together and uh
she was the one that had the little
watering can and
i was the seed in the uh in the soil but
that it took the watering can
uh from susie to uh to help me
really grow up and mature
she was a wonderful person and uh
she believed in me she she she she put
me together and
i would i would not have been
uh i would not only turn out to be the
person i'd
turned up me but i i would not have i
actually wouldn't have been as
successful in business without that
uh she made me more of a whole person
she never cared about
money or or business at all
one time we had dinner with a friend of
mine her wolf in new york and as we were
coming back on the subway
to manhattan he lived out out of ways
she said warren she said how many
hundred thousands are there in a million
uh and at that time i i knew i shouldn't
turn the checkbook over
well i don't know that you know you'll
have to go to rogers and hammerstein or
somebody to
figure out exactly what happens when you
meet somebody and
you know that stranger across the room
or something of the sort but
but i knew she was for me so i i didn't
waste any time i
i uh i wasn't getting any place for
but my pursuit was was avid and and uh
so she she married me when she was 19
and i was 21. i bought the ring i told
bill gates
when i was trying to sell him a rig when
he was going to get married in 19
he got married on january 1st 1994 i
said i spent six percent of my net worth
on my ring for susie so i think when you
come out to our jewelry store that
that's just it's a guideline but uh you
know you might bury it a little bit but
six percent is more or less the standard
amount
the wedding gate was kind of interesting
because i was a member of the national
guard
uh here in nebraska and on april 19th
in 1952 the missouri river was
coming up over its banks and i was
getting married at three in the
afternoon and at
noon i got a call and the guy i
answered the phone and fellow said
corporal buffett and i said yes sir and
he said this is captain murphy and
he said what time are you getting
married i said three o'clock he said
we've been activated so be at the armory
at five so that was
uh that was not an auspicious start for
the uh
wedding day and then a little while
later i got a call from
the commanding general of the 34th
division and he said i'm countermanding
captain murphy's
orders so go and have a great time on
the honeymoon uh
fortunately my uh the original call
from captain murphy captain murphy
stuttered somewhat and otherwise i would
have thought it was one of the
the ushers in the wedding or something
playing a game out of me i might have
i might have made some comment that
would have landed me in the bearings for
a few months i
did not wear my glasses in my wedding i
can't i couldn't then i think one of the
eyes has been corrected somewhat but
uh i couldn't see anything without my
glasses and i was so nervous that i
i just decided take off my glasses and i
wouldn't i wouldn't be able to see all
those people out there
well she had a fantastic voice and
and uh she always likes to sing i like
to sing too but
unfortunately i didn't have the voice
she had but uh
so she decided in the mid 1970s that
she'd like to try and uh do it in front
of crowds and it's no fun
initially singing in front of crowd but
i encourage her to do it and
and she started performing uh her
locally some
and then she also did a little a little
bit in
in new york my friend bill rowan we
started calling him broadway bill
because he went around
greenwich village and places lined up
lined up gigs for
uh she was very very good
well i like to eat everything that i had
at my sixth birthday party i thought
that was
i thought the menu there was superb you
know with hamburgers and hot dogs and
and uh coke and
uh chocolate sundaes and so
i found what agreed to me at a very
early age and i've continued now to age
85 and it still seems to work
i've i've really never eaten
i don't see any reason to eat your 40th
favorite
food when you can eat your favorite food
and and uh
uh i've really found
i've had 500 meals or maybe even
thousand dollar meals and i found
they're not as good as you know
what i can have when i get a good
hamburger and some fresh fries and a
coke so
i i don't see any reason to uh
to eat what other people like and i know
that if i'd
been eating broccoli and spinach and
brussels sprouts and
asparagus all my life that that i don't
think i'd have lived this long i i think
uh i think that it would have seemed
like a long time but i uh
i think my diet has worked very well for
me i'm not advocating it for others but
but uh it seemed to work very well for
me
well my mother had a tough time i mean
her mother ended up in a mental hospital
and and
and she already she carried a lot of the
burdens of her family her
her brother who she worshiped died very
young
and and and she was looked at as the
mainstay and
and uh uh you know she followed my
dad obviously to washington she pitched
in on everything involving my dad but
but uh uh she had
uh i'm almost sure that
they were migraine she they had a
different term in those days for him and
and so she
she uh she had she carried a lot of the
world's burdens
on her shoulders and and uh
she uh
she would she could be difficult
sometimes and then she could be
other times but but when she uh when she
got difficult
the three children felt it she was very
very bright and she was very gregarious
she was a good campaigner for my dad
but but uh
she'd gone through a lot of strains i
mean she after she
graduated from high school she worked
for a couple years before
to get the funds actually to go to the
university of nebraska where she met my
dad and
i think there was a lot of unhappiness
which she never talked about you know in
her growing up that
uh uh affected uh
uh her attitude to some extent and i
think
they didn't call them my i forget the
terms that they used in those days but
uh but i think they were migraines and
she was in physical pain a fair amount
of the time
well he had various nicknames for me
he'd call me fireball sometimes and
uh it would you know i got very
interested in the stock market so
uh jesse livermore was a famous stock
speculator sometimes he called me that
he had he had a lot of different names
for me that uh
that uh but he probably fireball was the
uh number one term i had a lot of energy
is
you know i i still have a lot of energy
when i'm doing something i like and and
uh i was
i was inquisitive and and uh
and i like to talk to grown-ups a lot so
anytime his friends came over
uh uh or the family's friends uh i would
have a great time
uh uh talking uh i i usually would talk
to the men when they came over but
if i was wandering around the
neighborhood i'd go in and talk to
housewives various places i
uh and i had a lot of energy and ideas
and you know
and i'd start little businesses or
something of a sort and
and i think he was entertained by it and
i think maybe that's where the fireball
came from
well when i
first first books i read on investment
were actually in my dad's office
i would go down on on saturday to
he would have lunch down at johnny's
cafe uh
with us either one or two partners uh
uh at the south all my feed company and
so i would i i love to go to those
lunches but i get down there early and
i'd
be reading the books in the office and
pretty soon i read all the books in the
office so i started
going over to the public library and i i
i you know i love to just run go to the
stacks where the business books were
and i read them all uh all the
investment books
um well before we moved to washington
when i was 12
and read some of them more than once and
you know i i basically loved reading and
the library uh uh we didn't buy books in
those days uh
the library was uh was a great place for
me and i would
take the street car down often and go to
the ymca and go to the library and
and then go home uh around dinner time
uh i actually got locked into the
what was then the university of omaha
library one time when i got
i got uh terribly enmeshed in
in reading in some stacks that were way
in the back and they locked the place up
i couldn't get out so i it took me
several hours before i could
rouse my father-in-law who was a dean
there and he got a janitor to
finally let me out of the library
well when we were in omaha but before i
was we moved to washington i would say i
was
quite gregarious and i was but i was
gregarious with adults as well as
as kids i was i was certainly shy with
girls although
that was not unusual in those days but i
did
i i've always i've i like being with
people
focus has always been
a strong part of my personality if i get
interested in something i get really
and and that was true
um about any subject i mean my
if i get if i get interested in new
subject i want to read about it i want
to talk about it and i want to meet
people that are
involved in it and and uh but that's
true of most of my friends i mean
charlie munger is a very focused guy
that uh for example and and uh uh
i don't think i could have done remotely
what i've
been able to do in business unless i if
i hadn't had that
really intense focus i mean i i i would
go through a 2000 page
moody's manual you know page by page at
night you know
looking at companies and thinking about
them and
and it it really it paid off
my my my two sisters uh uh
about equidistant on each side of me a
couple years older with doris a couple
years younger with birdie and
and uh we actually we had a lot of fun
together
uh uh they you know as they
as they grew older that uh you know
doris got interested in boys first
because she was the oldest and and
uh so they were the age difference to
some extent
affected the relate the precise
relationship we had at any time but but
but uh i really liked both of my sisters
a lot and and uh we were competitive in
certain ways uh
we used to have spell downs in grade
school where you'd have
six from each class and you'd go to the
next class upward then those 12 would
spell words until they're only six
remaining and then they would go up to
the further class it was always
my ambition to move up past doris who
was a couple years ahead of me and i'm
sure bernie's ambition was to get past
me so
uh but we you know we had we had fun
driving in the cars we had fun singing
a whole bunch of different things it was
uh i was lucky to have the sisters i had
when i was born in 1930 the difference
between being a male baby and a female
baby was
was huge at birth that my sisters
are fully as smart as i am uh
they've got better personalities than i
have certainly they didn't
in our younger years particularly and uh
no one ever said my dad mother loved us
all equally that
the teachers took equal interest in it
in us but
but the expectations were just different
because i was a boy and they were girls
i mean the
the the the thought was for them that
you know they should marry well and
maybe learn to be a
secretary or whatever it might be if
they wanted to have some temporary
employment before they got married and
started having children
the expectation with me was that that
the sky was the limit and
uh it it was just night and day and that
that struck me very early on as as
really
incredibly unfair uh and uh
uh and of course i continue to see other
examples in my life but the
the initial examples really were my
sisters i mean here were here were two
human beings that uh terrific
personalities very bright you know
you couldn't have better people and
the teachers never said to them you
don't have the same opportunities as
warren my parents certainly never said
anything like that
but it was there and it was there
throughout the society
well in the investment world uh
you really if you if you're emotional
about investments you're not gonna
you're not going to do well i mean facts
are facts and reason is reason
and and you can develop
all these attachments or or
or angers or whatever about your stock i
mean you may love the ones that go up
and hate the ones
that that's crazy i mean the stock
doesn't know you own it you may have all
these feelings about the stock the stock
has no feelings about you
it's going to reflect what the company
behind the stock does so
uh our charlie
mongers and my investment decisions and
our business decisions
don't have emotion in them we have
plenty of emotions
for other situations i mean it's not
that we're unemotional about
about about the people we care about or
anything of the sort
but business and investment decisions uh
if you get emotions in the equation
you're going to do a lot of dumb things
i really think that business in america
uh obviously the country's developed new
products come along and all of that but
i
i think uh
the role of managers really hasn't
changed significantly i mean you want
people who are leaders you want people
who can
who can see over the next hill and
people are willing to follow them
uh you want people that are always
dissatisfied
uh with the status quo and figure
there's a better way of
of making that widget or getting to
market or whatever it may be
uh the market system that this country
has enjoyed is
is remarkable in terms of unleashing
human potential
and and it continues to do that
decade after decade and that's why in my
lifetime alone the real gdp
per person in the united states has gone
up six for one in one person's lifetime
i mean it's
when you think of the centuries that in
the past where
humans at the end of the century were
living exactly the same as at the start
of the century
and then you see the galloping uh
uh pace
of progress in this country since 1776
it makes you realize we really have
found the secret sauce in a market
system now there's
a lot of things that that also need some
tempering in a market system but
but it does lead to more and more
uh goods and services that people want
than than any any other system in the
world
the nature of an advanced market system
is to concentrate greater and greater
rewards on the people that
happen to be adapted very well to it
and to leave a greater and greater
distance between them
and the people that absolutely are
necessary to their success
further behind so the gap will widen uh
absent taxation or other government
policies that that
treat the people that do something to
emil ameliorate that difference
between those who have market skills of
enormous value
uh you know just an arbitrary juror in
new york who makes
you know tens of millions of dollars a
year spotting little discrepancies in
price
compared to a soldier in afghanistan you
know is getting shot at for
for a pittance per month so it
it's a wonderful system for turning out
the market system is a wonderful system
for turning out lots of goods and
services
uh it's going to distribute them more
and more unequally
as it progresses it's a natural
phenomenon it's not because people are
evil or anything of the sort and
and so there there have to be has to be
some countervailing
activities primarily by government to
make sure that in an incredibly
prosperous society that people who work
hard
and are good citizens uh don't end up uh
uh really being left behind in a true in
an abysmal way
the philanthropy comes uh
from the realization that
money that has no utility to me it can't
be a buy me one thing i've got
everything i want
and i could have everything i want with
one percent of the net worth i have or
even
a tenth of one percent of the net worth
i have uh on the other hand
that money has enormous utility other
people it can it can save lives it can
educate people it can do all kinds of
things so
it's silly for me to not
transfer that utility over to uh
to people who can use it that it's doing
me no good
well i wouldn't say that i would say the
greed
has gotten me in trouble i uh
i don't i don't think greed is a big
part of
of investing i mean investing is an
attempt to
put capital into places that where it's
going to
produce a very good return and
but i think i think usually greed has
some aspect of perhaps of nd in it it's
the aspiration just to have
have money for its own sake uh uh
money really doesn't it doesn't do you
any good beyond a point so it's
it agreed would be sort of an illogical
uh pursuit uh uh i want to do
intelligent things
and i want to do them i'm doing on on my
own behalf i'm doing on behalf of the
shareholders of berkshire uh i i would
not want greedy partners i mean if i've
got greedy partners i've got a problem
uh i'd like them to go elsewhere i would
like people
to be my partners who expect a
reasonable return from intelligent
decisions made over a long period of
time
i read the omaha world herald i read
the new york times the wall street
journal the financial times and
and i also read usa today uh
well probably the the worst
the worst mistakes involve not
understanding other people as well
uh as you might i mean i'm not as smart
in a technical sense uh i'm not nearly
as smart as i was 50 years ago if you
gave me a
test involving memory or you know
ability to pick up new ideas or do math
in my head or whatever it might be i
would not score as well
uh as i would have when i was 20 or 30.
i think i know a lot more about people
than i knew when i was 20 or 30 so that
i wish i'd known as much about people
when i was 20 as i think i know now
and would have been helpful in a lot of
ways
well there are going to be crooks in
every society i don't think our society
breeds more of them than other societies
but they're
they're people that for one way or
another uh
um go down the wrong path and uh they do
that in the business world sometimes
they do it in the investing world
and uh
i think that just because of my
background
sometimes i can spot the people that are
doing it in the investing world
sooner than the authorities end up
catching up with them
so there have been times when both
charlie munger and i have
pointed out certain activities that we
think are
either distasteful or dishonest or uh
and and but that will that's that will
be with us forever i mean that
there there's big money in investing in
finance
and business huge money and there are
various ways to cheat
and people figure out nuances as time
goes by and
and sometimes the authorities are very
slow to catch on to what's going on
uh they there tends to be more of that
i believe you can't prove it uh
during bull markets than than during
ordinary markets people's
people's morals seem to loosen up as as
stocks rise rapidly in price and and
there's a feeling that
kind of anything goes uh and that the
other guy's doing it so why shouldn't i
that was what was going on in the late
60s when i wound up my partnership there
were a lot of people getting very rich
by playing games basically in stocks and
i didn't like i didn't like my results
being compared with their results
they were going to beat me in the game
and then i didn't want to do what they
were doing so uh that's one
major reason i wound up the partnership
the first time we had our meeting of the
graham group
was in 1968 and when the 11 of us met
with ben graham you know basically we
were saying to ben
how long can this go on because there
are all kinds of games being played on
wall street and
and the press applauded them and
investors applauded them and these
people were becoming heroes and
basically they were you know they were
they were engaged in creating mirages
with accounting
and uh ben said it could go on a long
time but it'll come to an end eventually
and of course that's what happened
it has to be there honesty is uh
you know first of all i have to be
honest with our shareholders i've got
i think over a million shareholders of
berkshire hathaway they're my partners
and they have entrusted me with the
money and
and it's one reason in the annual report
i try and tell them about
mistakes i've made as well as you know i
believe it's an annual report not an
annual sales document
uh and i it's a lot easier than as
charlie says and you know
you don't have to remember what you said
if you have here if you're really saying
what's the truth as you go along
when i'm no longer around uh
berkshire's culture is so deep
and some i wouldn't call it unique but
it's certainly special
uh uh and it it permeates
our board of directors it permeates our
shareholders base that permeates our
manage managers so
i think it would be very difficult
to come in and change the culture in any
major way i think that that it would
be rejected like a like a foreign
object uh uh so i i think
uh we're so big that we can't have
percentage results anything like we've
had in the past
but we can be a very decent business and
i think it can go on
uh for a very very long time without
changing its
its character uh the sums involved will
get larger as it goes along but
the basic principles around berkshire
it's one of the reasons i stick them in
the back of the annual report i've
written the principles of
of the economic principles of berkshire
i've put in the annual report for 35
years or so nobody else does that in
their reports but
those are that's the way we look at
at the company and we want our partners
to understand that and
and i'm not only boxing myself in when i
put those in i'm sort of boxing
my successor to and to some extent
i try to write in the annual report
certain things that
will box in my successors to some degree
but uh
because berkshire berkshire has to
have to fit it has to be a certain kind
of structure and operation
uh over the years and i've had 50 years
plus to uh to build that structure and i
i think that uh i'm sure
uh virtually that my successor or
more than one will will follow the same
general path they'll do things
differently obviously
but they will do things differently in
terms of our
the basic tenets of the business
i've been very lucky in family i've been
i've been lucky and been lucky and
didn't want to you know i've been lucky
in geography i mean
i've been lucky in the time when i was
born i mean
it would not have been as much fun being
born 200 years ago i think about that
every time i go to the dentist
it's a different world now than that i
mean just think of childbirth you know a
few hundred years ago or something of
the sort
and we are very lucky that
uh you know at least i consider myself
very lucky i was born in 1930 rather
than 1730. there's an enormous amount of
life
how you're wired you know whether i was
born female or male 1 was whether i was
born black or white i mean it was
i mean that was huge you know in
in 1930 it's still big but it was it
was night and day in terms of the
opportunity i was going to have if
i've been born black and i would not
have
you know who knows where i would have
ended up but i would certainly would
have been you know i would have had a
whole different life
that had nothing to do with me
