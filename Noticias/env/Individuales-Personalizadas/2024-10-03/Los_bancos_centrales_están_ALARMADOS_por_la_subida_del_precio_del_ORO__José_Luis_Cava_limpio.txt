Hello, how are you? Very good morning from
Madrid, as you can see,
we have a wonderful morning. The
central bankers are terrified by
the sharp rise experienced by the
price of gold. The question we are going to
try to answer today is: And why in the
first place?  We must keep in mind
that central banks have always
been deeply involved in the
Gold market, although we have not
seen what the central banks were pursuing
with their involvement in the
Gold market. It is very easy to depress the
price of gold, agree to repress it for
two reasons.  firstly so that
citizens were not aware of the
pyramid scheme that Fiat currencies represent
so that citizens would not
feel able to manage their
positions in gold, increasing
volatility and increasing
falls and lateral movements. And
secondly, to put pressure on
governments so that they had a high
percentage of their reserves in dollars.
I am Spanish and I experienced what
the Government of Spain did in 2007 with
solves as Minister of Economy and
Finance, what it did was sell a large
part of the gold reserves.  of Spain and
look what he said he sold them
because he said they were not profitable this
is a lie okay it is a lie but
this man would have to say something to
make this barbarism profitable for a
Central Bank for a very simple reason
because a Central Bank with the
gold reserves that you have, you can make money by
lending them as we will see
below, okay, and even if
they are poorly given, I can use the
gold reserves to increase the
money supply, therefore what he
said was a lie, but it also
clearly shows the  big mistake taking
a look at the Gold chart but
my son How is it not profitable when you
sold it was at the minimum at 500
eur per Ounce and now it is close to
2400 How is it not profitable but
there are more most likely  that this
enormous amount of gold was sold
to the Chinese government, but my son, how
can you sell gold to the Chinese government and not
realize that you are making a
mistake? Well, you see the
two reasons because the
central banks depressed the price of gold.  gold well
and how they did it because of course when one
goes to see the gold markets
the central banks do not appear well they did not do it
because they did it through what is
called in the gold markets
bullion banks well What are bullion banks
bullion, well, bullion banks
are the investment banks that operate
in the gold market, which are
fundamentally five entities. I'm
thinking, for example, of Deutsche Ban. I
'm thinking of Bank of America. I'm
thinking of JP Morgan. I'm thinking of
Gold Masac. Now, yes.  They want to
have a detail of who these
investment banks are. Just
go to the media and
see where the employees who
have been convicted of manipulating the
price of gold worked. Well,
then the central banks
intervened in the gold market.
depressing prices or trying to
depress prices through the
bullion banks well and how
they did it well the bullion banks
what they did was sell gold But
where did they get the gold from well it was
imaginary gold it was paper gold they sold the
future of  gold Pin Pin Pin Pin and at a
certain time when the
final liquidation of the positions they
had open in gold arrived, if they had to
contribute or if as a result of that
liquidation they had to deliver
physical gold, then the central banks would come
and lend them the gold they
They actually needed
the Bank of England to intervene, but how did they carry out
the operation to be able to follow it and
find the evidence? Well, the operation
was masked, okay, because they
did it through the International Bank
of Payments, as you know, the
International Bank of Payments is the Bank of the United
States.  central bankers agreed and
then what they did was that they lent
the money, they lent the gold to the
bullion banks through operations they
carried out with the international
payments bank with the famous swaps and
gold leases according to the
international payments bank.  It issues a
monthly report on the operations it
carries out but you have to be a very expert and I am
not an expert to detect these
operations because they were
covering them up and if you
are covering something up and you do not master
transparency it is because things are not very
clear.  Okay, well, that's
how the Gold market has been manipulated
until 2022, but in
2022 a modification appears. I'm going to
explain to you on January 1, 2022 after years
after several years of delaying the entry
into force of the agreements.  Basel 3
notable modifications were introduced in
the Gold market so that you
know. The Basel 3 agreements
are essentially rules that emanate from the
international payments bank, which I
have already told you is the bank of
central bankers, but the most  It is
important that the international
payments bank does not respond to any
government and the Basel 3 agreements are
incorporated into the current legislation of
the countries in Spain, which is the case that
I know more about through the
circulars of the Bank of Spain
according to and  If it is necessary to approve a law
by law in parliament And that law is not
discussed, no one, I remember, has PSO and PP
vote for it in agreement in such a way that it
incorporates the legislation The
Basel 3 agreements What was the most
important modification that was postponed  Its entry into
force this January 2022, very easy to
remember, due to the imposition of Russia and with
the support of China, a modification was introduced
in the Basel
3 agreements by virtue of which the
bullion banks, which were the ones that sold
imaginary gold if they wanted  To continue carrying out
these practices, they should have the
physical gold that they sell as paper gold,
in such a way that this
obviously discourages
operations, but they also
introduced one more modification, which is
that if they wanted to sell gold and did not have
the physical gold, they would have to back it up.
with a percentage of their own resources,
this meant in practice that they
ate up a part of their own resources and
therefore the leverage that they
could obtain by lending money was
significantly reduced in such a way
that these operations
completely discouraged gold trading desks.
of gold January 2022 the
bullion banks disappear well And
then how the central banks intervene
in the Gold market
they intervene directly you understand the
idea but on February 24, 2022 Russia
invades Ukraine and this means that the
United States automatically sanctions
Russia  agreement and confiscates the
reserves that and Europe confiscates the
reserves that it had deposited in
European banks, the banks around the world,
especially China. Especially the
bricks, what they do from that
moment on is reduce the holdings of
dollars that they have in their reserves and
trigger the increase in
gold holdings, you can see how in the year
2022 they increase significantly,
a historical record of
gold purchases by central banks is reached
and this trend also continued until
now in such a way that we
find that  The gold market right now
is dominated by the
gold purchases made by the
central banks. In this we find that
the Western banks, upon seeing that the
bricks, their fellow bricks are
buying gold, one of the
Western banks says Hey, me too and so
which is that they are reducing the
dollar holdings that they have in their
reserves and increasing the gold holdings in such a
way that at this moment we
find that the
second asset in which the
gold reserves are being materialized the most are
the reserves that the
central banks is in gold after the dollar and
has displaced the Euro to third place,
so of course the rest of the banks
say Well if my colleagues are
buying gold Well, I'm also going to
buy gold and here comes the
philosophical change until now some
central banks  that were depressing the
price of gold ironically
become champions of gold and
begin to buy gold and are fans of the
Free Market agree. This is the
reason why the Gold trend
is accentuating and now the
central banks that do not have  those of
bullion that right now they do not
want to sell gold because they want to
keep what they have. Where does the
price of gold arise because it arises from the purchases
made by the central banks and now
we find that now the
fund managers have discovered gold and the
Gold ETFs are registering significant inflows
into these investment funds that
invest in gold and individuals, which
was one of the fundamental sources of
buying gold, now cannot think
that now a Russian
needs all of his salary to buy four gold bars.
of the year the same is happening with
the Chinese and the same is happening with
the Indians in such a way that now
gold is dominated by the purchases of the
central banks and by the purchases of
investment funds, okay, I'll leave it
here for you.  May you meditate and not I
refuse to finish with a
question 2400 eur per ounce of gold
seems expensive to you If that's okay
I'll comment on it next Wednesday bye bye see you
later have a good day
