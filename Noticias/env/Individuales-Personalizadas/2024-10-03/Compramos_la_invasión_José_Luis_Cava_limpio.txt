Hello, how are you? Very good morning from
Madrid, as you can see,
we have a beautiful morning. You are going to
allow me to send a greeting to all the
people who follow us from Uruguay and
especially to Los Seguidores del
Peñarol and among them to Ernesto who  He
has come here to Madrid to give some
talks about bitcoin and he has given me
a cap from the Peñarol club Atlético
Peñarol, champion of the century. Having said that, we are
going to the markets. The first question I
am going to ask you is the
following, taking into account the
worsening of the  conflict between Iran and
Israel Why do the
stock markets not collapse why the
price of oil does not rise sharply according to the
answer to this question is simple
because you do not realize that there
has been a change in
China's monetary policies
of  Japan and the United States with
expansive monetary policies. What do
the stock markets have to do? Well, man, I
already know that we are in the month of October,
which is a seasonally bearish month
and the most likely thing, if we already take
seasonality into account, is that October
will close with a  decrease of 2%
compared to September but the stock markets
are not collapsing well let's
start with the oil market
you know perfectly well that we
have said here many times that the
oil minister of Arita was
wrong he swings in agreement by
unilaterally cutting the  production
below the quota that
the OPE had without anything, well look at the
news that came out yesterday in the Wall Street
journal, as you can see, the
Wall Street journal reveals that there has
been a confrontation between
Saudi Arabia and the rest of  partners of the opet
in which the minister of oil of
Saudi Arabia has threatened, albeit
veiledly, to start a
price war of agreement that could take the
price of oil to the area of
50 evidently gave this news as it
could not be otherwise  So it has been denied
by OPEC itself but there you have it,
if we go to the graph, which
are no longer divine words, you see that
the price of oil has remained
above the 60 zone, which is a
clear support zone and you see.
Well, it has had a rise But we can
classify that rise as a
Modest rise, therefore the price of
oil has not risen, let's go to
monetary policies Why don't the
stock markets fall Man, my opinion is that the
stock markets have a tailwind okay
We have the elections in the
United States, as for the elections in the United
States, you know
perfectly well that burning and tranquility,
neither of them is going to reduce the
public deficit, as you can see,
the rate of indebtedness in the
United States is growing.  It
means that the public sector is going to
continue spending money and if the
public sector is going to continue spending money, well,
probably, the most likely thing is that
the economy will continue to grow. Let's go to
monetary policies. If you take
into account what has happened in China,
we have seen.  As a
double package has been approved, a monetary stimulus package
and fiscal stimulus, and
you see how the Chinese stock markets are
rising like crazy as a result of
the cancellation of short positions. Well,
what has happened in Japan? Well, in Japan it
has been incredible.  The first thing
the new Prime Minister has done is
meet with the governor of the
Central Bank of Japan. Well, the
independence of the Central Bank of Japan
is over, you know what I want to
tell him, so he told him that
right now the Prime Minister told him
that  Right now Japan's economy
is not prepared for this man to
start raising interest rates and
he is probably right because
you take into account as you can see
that inflation has fallen in
Japan, okay, but it is that we  We are
also finding that with a
debt ratio of 400 per
public debt, as interest rates rise,
you are going to cause a major mess
and as you can see in this
graph, these are no longer divine words.
You see how the price of the  dollar
against the l has rebounded upon reaching
the 140 zone and is rising with which
we have two favorable winds two
expansive monetary policies and then
Finally we have the United States what am I
going to tell you if we
find that our friend Poell has
reduced 50 basis points when it was not
necessary, evidently because there is
coordination between the three in agreement and
therefore Although I am one of those who
thinks that although during the month of
October we experience a correction, the
question we have to ask ourselves is the
following: we have  I have to take advantage of
Lebanon to buy bags. And it
falls. I'm going to leave it to you to
think about, but I'm going to anticipate it and
tell you what I think. Well, I
think so because the most likely thing is
that the sp500 will continue.  going up once
the month of October has passed in view of the
electoral process in the United States, I
leave it here for you to meditate on,
have a good day, next day we will talk
about
