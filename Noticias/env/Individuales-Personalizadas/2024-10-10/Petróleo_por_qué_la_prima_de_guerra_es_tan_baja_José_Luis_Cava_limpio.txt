Hello how are you Very good morning
outside Hello how are you Very good and as
you can see sunny mornings
from Madrid the question we are going to
ask ourselves today is the following Why is the
war premium so low Why is the
price of oil  has not reacted
with strong increases to the risk of war
between Iran and Israel Why is the price not
quoting the mother of all
cuts in oil supplies to
answer this question the first thing
we are going to take into account is this
photograph this photograph collects  the
moment in which the
foreign minister of Iran visited his
Saudi counterpart and you see that there is a
third person that third person is
the Saudi crown prince why this
photo has reassured the markets very
simply Because what Saudi Arabia
intends is  obtain guarantees from Iran
that in its response in its retaliation to
Israel's attacks it will not choose to
bomb the oil fields of
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait or the
Arab Emirates or that it ends up closing
the Strait of Ormu, which is why this photo has
calmed the markets  But it is
enough to justify this low
war premium, well, man. I think
not. So how is this low
war premium justified? Very simple. Because there have
been conditions that have changed
since 2006, we find that
right now the United States is the
main producer of  oil in the
world in second place because the
Western countries, their governments have
decided that they are going to react to an
excessive rise in the price of oil
by selling all their reserves
in accordance and also because they have lowered
the sanctions to Costa from losing
political credibility to  countries like
Venezuela in such a way that they
intend to raise an
oil supply, but we also
find ourselves with specific aspects of
the markets. First of all,
we are seeing that if you compare
the situation of the
oil markets and specifically the
derivatives markets,  From 2006
to our current moment,
practically the traded volumes
have multiplied by 15, with which
many oil consumers
have been able to hedge and for
that reason the price of oil is not going
to rise in one way or another.
immediate reaction and then finally
we must also take into account that
the information systems have been improved
okay now we have information via
satellite in real time tracking
the ships leaving the ports
therefore the rumors have disappeared
And we have that source  of
information for that reason, as
you can see, the price of
oil is closer to 60
than close to 100 and it is most likely
that it will move in a bearish lateral movement.
I leave it here
for you to meditate on.  about it and
have a great day goodbye see you later
ah
